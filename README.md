# routines

## Summary

A set of common build routines and steps.

Many projects require similiar build instructions which only differ regarding
certain parameters specific to their repository, such as the name of the
compilation target.  Writing them from scratch over and over again for each new
repository is not efficient and leaves the build routines in an unsynchronised
state.  In case a critical bug should be found in one of them, all would need
to be edited by hand in order to fix it.
